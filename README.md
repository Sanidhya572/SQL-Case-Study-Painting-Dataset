# Art Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

ðŸš€ Welcome to my latest project! In this project, I've automated the process of loading CSV data into PostgreSQL tables and conducted an in-depth analysis of art-related data using SQL queries. Leveraging Python's pandas and SQLAlchemy, I've streamlined the data loading process, ensuring efficient organization and storage of data for enhanced database management. This automation not only saves time but also ensures seamless data handling.


## Technologies and Database used
* Postgre SQL
* PgAdmin4
* Pandas
* SQLAlchemy
* Python 


## SQL Queries and Analysis

ðŸ“Š Following the successful data loading process, I delved deeper into the PostgreSQL database, conducting an insightful analysis of paintings, artists, museums, and more using SQL queries. Each query unveils valuable insights, empowering decision-making processes and facilitating further exploration.


## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into the art world, enabling data-driven decision-making processes and facilitating further exploration. Stay tuned for more updates and analyses!
